        <h1>Jason Callaghan-Barrett</h1>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I have been working as a disibility support worker for the past 9 years which has been a life enriching and character growing career.
            <br></br>
            I am currently seeking a switch in career paths. As such I have undergone study and completed a certIV in IT{'(Programming)'} at TAFE
            through online study. As I completed this course in 2022 as a complete beginner and have since continued working as a support worker
            while participating in self learning to improve upon my overall proficency in software development.

            My projects have largely been in areas of interest for myself and any cool ideas to motivate myself to practice my C#, database, Python,
            HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
 
            During my course I also worked on some database stuff utilising MSSMS.
            I've had a long time interest in technology but due to circumstances I was unable to pursue a career related to this interest.
            However I've since decided to resume pursuing a career in technology in the form of software development. 
            I think it's so cool to be able to develop useful applications to make the lives of everyone better and easier, 
            I think this is a form of useful that appeals to me most and the ways I'd want to be useful.

        </p>
        <h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
        <p>I have been developing my skills in a broad spectrum in an attempt to grasp full stacks concepts in a somewhat practical sense 
            as quickly as possible.<br></br>
            React has been my library of choice to practice my frontend development.
            Node.js and Express for backend and server capabilities.
            In terms of database intergration I've been utilising PostgreSQL.
            I'm very interested in getting real life experience, to see the workflow and software that is utilised in a real work place.
            
        </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        The things I like working on are kind of in the realm of record keeping but I like to try and present it in interesting ways.
        I love when things finally click and work, I love the sense of progression when something that was originally undecipherable alien language
        suddenly starts to make sense. I also find it fun to go back to my code and sort it out, format it in more organised ways.
