        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have been working as a disibility support worker for the past 7 years. It has been a life enriching and character growing career
            but I am currently seeking a switch in career paths. As such I have undergone study and completed a certIV in IT{'(Programming)'} at TAFE
            through online study. As I completed this course in 2022 as a complete beginner and have since continued working as a support worker
            while participating in self learning to improve upon my programming skills.

            My projects have largely been in areas of interest for myself and any cool idea to motivate myself to practice my C#, HTML, CSS and 
            Javascript skills.
            As a beginner I have been having most issue with structure, organisation and layout of my projects. During my course I also worked on some database
            stuff utilising MSSMS.
            I've had a long time interest in technology but due to circumstances I was unable to pursue ac career related to this interest.
            However I've since decided to resume pursuing a career in technology in the form of software development. I think it's so cool to be able to 
            develop useful applications to make the lives of everyone better and easier, I think this is a form of useful that appeals to me most and the ways
            I'd want to be useful.

        </p>
